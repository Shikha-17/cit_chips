  how_it_works: |

    See the [Wokwi gate layout and simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/357752736742764545). At a high level:
    
    * Seven flip-flops hold the cellular automaton's internal state, which is also displayed in the seven-segment display.
    * Combinatorial logic generates the next state for each segment based on its neighbors (the segments that touch it end to end: note that different segments have different numbers of neighbors), according to this ruleset:
      1. Living segments with exactly one living neighbor survive, and all others die.
      2. Dead segments with exactly two living neighbors come to life.
    * When either the system clock or a user-toggled clock input goes high, this new state is latched in.
    * There's minor additional support logic to let the user manually shift in an initial condition and handle clock dividing.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    For full details, see the [github README](https://github.com/icegoat9/tinytapeout03-7seglife) doc link. But at a high level, assuming the IC is mounted on the standard tinytapeout PCB which provides dip switches, clock, and a seven-segment display for output:
    
    1. Set all dip switches off, and the clock slide switch to the 'manual' clock side.
    2. Power on the system. An arbitrary state may appear on the 7-segment display.
    3. Set dip switch 4 on ('run mode').
    4. Toggle dip switch 1 on and off to advance the automaton to the next state, you should see the 7-segment display update.

    If you want to watch it run automatically (which may quickly settle on an empty state or a static pattern, depending on start state):
    
    1. Set the PCB clock divider to the maximum clock division (255). With a system clock of 6.25kHz, the clock input should now be ~24.5Hz.
    2. Set dip switches 5 and 7 on to add an additional 16x clock divider.
    3. Set dip switch 4 on.
    4. Switch the clock slide switch to the 'system clock' side. The display should advance at roughly 1.5Hz (if I've done math correctly)
    5. To run faster or slower, set a combination of dip switches 5 (8x clock divider), 6 (4x divider), and 7 (2x divider)
    
    If you want to load a custom initial state:
    
    1. Set dip switch 4 off ('load mode').
    2. Toggle dip switches 2 and/or 3 on and off up to seven times total, to shift in 0 and 1 values to the automaton's internal state (one suggested starting pattern: toggle dip switch 3 on and then off three times, then toggle dip switch 2 on and then off twice: this should display a 'lowercase u' on the 7-segment display).
    3. Set dip switch 4 on and run manually or automatically as above.

    Exercises / puzzles for the reader:
    
    1. How many unique initial states are there, disregarding equivalent mirrored/rotated states? (there are 2^7 = 128 possible initial states, but many are equivalent)
    2. What fraction of these initial states survive? (i.e. don't eventually die out)
    3. What fraction settle into a static living pattern vs an infinite cycle between multiple different patterns?
    4. What is the longest sequence of unique states a pattern travels through (stop counting once it reaches a previously-visited state, beginning an infinite loop)?
    5. What is the longest cycle of unique states that repeats in a loop?

    Detailed explanation:
    
    From the initial state shown in Step 0 below (where thin lines represent dark/dead segments, and solid blocks represent lighted/living segments), the automaton will evolve through each of the following states:
```
Step 0         Step 1         Step 2         Step 3         Step 4

 ███            ███            ---            ---            --- 
█   |          █   █          |   |          |   |          |   |          
█   |          █   █          |   |          |   |          |   |   
 ---            ███            ---            ███            --- 
|   █          |   |          █   █          |   |          █   █
|   █          |   |          █   █          |   |          █   █
 ---            ---            ---            ███            ---
```
To determine the state in Step 1:
* The two connected segments in the upper left of Step 0 survive (as they each have one living neighbor)
* The disconnected segment in the lower right of Step 0 dies (zero neighbors)
* Two segments are born in previously-empty locations: the upper right (it has the top segment and lower right segment in Step 0 as two living neighbors), and the middle segment (the upper left and lower right are its two living neighbors).

During Step 2, all the four segments in Step 1 die (two neighbors), but two new segments are born.

During Step 3, two segments die and two more are born.

During Step 4, two segments die and two more are born, and we realize it's in an infinite loop between this state and the previous state.
