  wokwi_id:    357752736742764545        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately

#    - counter.v

#  top_module:  "seven_segment_seconds"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Simple 7-segment cellular automaton"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      * Seven flip-flops hold the cellular automaton's internal state, which is also displayed in the seven-segment display.
      * Combinatorial logic generates the next state for each segment based on its neighbors, according to the ruleset:
      TBD (for now, see github README)

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
